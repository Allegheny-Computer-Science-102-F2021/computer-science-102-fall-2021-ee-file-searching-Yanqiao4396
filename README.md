# File Searching


## Ideas
This project is to search for a word in a file. Compared with the first project, since I took a more high-level class and got more knowledge, this project has more advanced codes such as CLI interface. 

## Outputs

```
poetry run search --word ethical --dir input --file proactive.txt
```
```
ðŸ˜ƒ Searching through the file called input/proactive.txt!

Was the word "ethical" found in the file input/proactive.txt? Yes
```


```
poetry run search --word conundrum --dir input --file proactive.txt
```
```
Was the word "conundrum" found in the file input/proactive.txt? No
```
